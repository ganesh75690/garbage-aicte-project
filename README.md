This project is a deep learning-based image classification model that automatically identifies and classifies waste into six categories: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash.
Built using TensorFlow and MobileNetV3Large, the model achieves near-perfect accuracy and is optimized for real-time inference.

A web interface is provided using Gradio, and the project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for instant live demo access.
